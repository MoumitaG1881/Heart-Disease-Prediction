# Heart-Disease-Prediction Using Logistic Regression Model
Heart Disease:\
WHO has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This whole research intends to pinpoint the ratio of patients who possess a good chance of being affected by CVD and also to predict the overall risk using Logistic Regression.\
Logistic Refression:\
Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning technique classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields. It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more sets of independent variables to predict outcomes. It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.\
Data Preparation:\
The data (patientsâ€™ information) is taken from an ongoing cardiovascular study on the town of Framingham (Massachusetts). The classification goal is to predict whether a patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease. Dataset contains 4,000 records and 15 attributes.\
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\
10 Year Chronic Heart Disease Record of the patients Note: 0: Not Affected, 1: Affected\
Fitting Logistic Regression Model\
Accuracy Evaluation of Logistic Regression Model\
Formation of Confusion Matrix
